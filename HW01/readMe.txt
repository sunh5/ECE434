My code is to draw a grid with a pen. Using "w a s d" keys can move the pen to up, down, left, and right.
Every time the pen moves, it will draw on the grade. Using "c" can clear the current position. 
When finished, use crtl+c to close the grid.

Your code works, but you forgot some details:

#!/usr/bin/env python3 and chmod +x are missing
You used HW01, should be hw01
ReadMe.md, not readMe.txt
