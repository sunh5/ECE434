# Project
My partner and I have created a wiki page including all the stuff of our project

# Blynk
Run setup.sh and install.sh first to set the BLYNK_AUTH to BeagleBone and set up the environment. Then run the leds.js or leds.py 
to blink the LED through the button in Blynk's UI, or use button on P9-11 to light the LED in Blynk. 

# A temperature display
Run setup.sh and temp.py to read the current temperature every 1 second. The Gauge display will show the current temperature read by the sensor. 

# Extra - Etch-a-sketch
Run setup.sh and etchBlynk.py to implement etch-a-sketch on LED matrix controlled by five buttons on blynk. 
V0 to V4 represent move up, left, down, right, and clear.
