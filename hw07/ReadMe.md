--------

# Project
My partner and I have created a wiki page including all the stuff of our project. We have installed opencv and did some research about it. We will build ssh connection between siri and beaglebone for next step. 

# Blynk
Run setup.sh and install.sh first to set the BLYNK_AUTH to BeagleBone and set up the environment. Then run the leds.js or leds.py 
to blink the LED through the button in Blynk's UI, or use button on P9-11 to light the LED in Blynk. 

# A temperature display
Run setup.sh and temp.py to read the current temperature every 1 second. The Gauge display will show the current temperature read by the sensor. 

# Extra - Etch-a-sketch
Run setup.sh and etchBlynk.py to implement etch-a-sketch on LED matrix controlled by five buttons on blynk.
